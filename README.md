# Machine-Learning-Project

Welcome to this project! 

Housing prices are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. Purchasing or selling a house is a big decision in anyoneâ€™s life and as a result, it is always good to know how much ahouse is worth. Predicted housing prices can help buyers plan their finances and sellers know the trend of the market. We were given data on the specific details of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, such as house square feet, number of fireplaces, lot size, flatness of the property, type of dwelling, etc, and we were supposed to use these features to predict the selling price of these homes.

In this repository, you will find the Jupyter Notebook, which has all of the code, and a report, which provides details about our group's approach to this problem, findings, analyses, and results.
